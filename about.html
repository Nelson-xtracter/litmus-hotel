                    <p>Since 2010, hotel management has undergone significant transformation, driven by technological advancements and evolving customer expectations.  Hoteliers have increasingly relied on data analytics to understand customer preferences, personalize services, and optimize pricing strategies through revenue management systems. The rise of eco-conscious travelers has pushed hotels towards sustainable practices, such as energy-efficient operations and reducing waste. Additionally, the focus on enhancing guest experience has led to innovative amenities and services, including wellness offerings. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated changes in hotel management, emphasizing the importance of hygiene protocols, contactless services, and flexible cancellation policies. As the industry continues to recover, hoteliers are also focusing on attracting domestic travelers and promoting longer stays. The shift towards a more customer-centric approach and the embrace of technology are expected to shape the future of hotel management, ensuring resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing landscape.
                        Furthermore, Litmus hotel fee structure is transparent and agreed upon by our management team, ensuring that you receive the best value for your money. We are committed to making every visit a memorable one and look forward to welcoming you as our valued customer. Let us elevate your experience and redefine what exceptional service means.</p>
